#### defender warden debug

* Usage: `!defender warden debug <_id> <event> [rank=None]`

Simulate and give a detailed summary of an event\
\
A Warden event must be passed with the proper target ID (user or local message)\
\
When this command is issued all the rules registered to the event will be\
processed in a safe way against the target, if any.\
If the target satisfies the conditions, _only_ the heatpoint related actions\
will be carried on.\
The heatpoint actions will be "sandboxed", so the newly added heatpoints won't\
have any effect outside this test.\
Remember that Warden evaluates each condition in order and stops at the first failed\
root condition: the last condition that is listed in a failed rule is where Warden\
stopped evaluating them.\
If a valid Rank is also passed it will be used in place of the target's real\
rank during the test.\
See the documentation for a full list of Warden events.\
\
Example:\
!def warden debug \<valid\_user\_id> on-user-join\
!def warden debug \<valid\_message\_id> on-message\
!def warden debug \<valid\_message\_id> on-message-edit 3
