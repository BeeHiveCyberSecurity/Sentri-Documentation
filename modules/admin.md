# üéü Admin

### Usage[¬∂](broken-reference)

This cog will provide tools for server admins and bot owners.

It can add or remove a role to a member, edit one or make some available for members so they can self-assign them as they wish.

It also provides tools for the bot owner such as server locking (once enabled, the bot will instantly leave new servers it joins) and announcements, which can send something in all the servers of the bot.

Tip

Another way to prevent your bot from being invited on more servers is making it private directly from the developer portal.

Once a bot is private, it can only be invited by its owner (or team owners). Other users will get an error on Discord‚Äôs webpage explaining that the bot is private.

To do this, go to the [Discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers), select your application, click ‚ÄúBot‚Äù in the sidebar, then untick ‚ÄúPublic bot‚Äù
